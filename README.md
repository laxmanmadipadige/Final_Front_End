Backend (Express.js and MongoDB):
Express.js Server Setup:

An Express.js server is set up to handle HTTP requests.
It uses the cors middleware to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing the frontend to make requests from a different domain.
It connects to a MongoDB database using Mongoose.
Endpoints for CRUD Operations:

There are three main endpoints (GET /notes, POST /notes, DELETE /notes) for performing CRUD operations on notes.
The GET endpoint fetches all notes from the database.
The POST endpoint adds a new note to the database.
The DELETE endpoint deletes a note from the database based on the provided title.
Mongoose Schema:

The Note model is defined using Mongoose to represent the structure of a note in the MongoDB database.
CORS Handling:

The backend server uses the cors middleware to handle CORS headers, allowing the frontend to make requests from a different origin.
Frontend (React):
React App Setup:

A React application is set up with functional components (App, Header, Footer, Note, CreateArea) and the axios library for making HTTP requests.
State Management:

The App component uses the useState hook to manage the state of notes retrieved from the backend.
UseEffect for Fetching Data:

The useEffect hook is used to fetch data from the Express.js backend when the component mounts.
The fetched data (an array of notes) is stored in the notes state.
Note Deletion:

The deleteNote function sends a DELETE request to the backend when a user wants to delete a note.
The deleted note is removed from the frontend state, providing a responsive user interface.
Rendering Components:

The App component renders a header, a form for creating new notes, and a list of notes fetched from the backend.
Each note has a delete button that triggers the deleteNote function.
Interaction with Backend:

The frontend interacts with the backend through Axios to perform CRUD operations on notes.
The UI updates dynamically based on changes in the frontend state.

Conclusion:
The backend and frontend work together to enable users to create, view, and delete notes.
The Express.js backend provides RESTful API endpoints for managing notes in a MongoDB database.
The React frontend fetches and displays notes, allowing users to add new notes and delete existing ones.
The combination of Express.js, MongoDB, and React enables a full-stack web application for note management.
